  Hello! My name is Akhilesh Yadav, and I love building creative and meaningful things for the internet. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by how websites work — I used to spend hours in inspect element, changing colors, layouts, and experimenting with small pieces of code just to see what happens. At the age of 16, I decided to turn that curiosity into a career and start my journey as a web developer.`,

    `
  Outside of coding, I’m passionate about photography and traveling. I enjoy exploring new places, capturing moments, and finding inspiration in the world around me — it often influences my design perspective and creative thinking.`,

  Coming back to web development — over time, I’ve worked on projects for clients across the globe.

    `
  I’m naturally observant and detail-focused, which helps me break down complex problems and solve them efficiently. As a creative thinker, I enjoy building clean, responsive, and functional websites that not only look good but perform even better.`,
